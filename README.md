# Tarpaulin Viewer

Parsing through massive debug logs of events is a pain and I was finding it
impossible to render them into SVGs without freezing up any software I tried.
This has been created to load a cargo-tarpaulin event log and render the
timeline of events in a way that makes sense. Also I'll probably fill in
things to make it easier to navigate the events or spot certain issues.

This is currently just meant for my own debugging, no stability guarantees
no interop. Probably no documentation outside the code.
